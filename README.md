SUPER SPRINT
============

SuperSprint is an attempt to recreate the famous game I've been playing for hours when I was a kid on our good old Atari ST 520 ([What was Super Sprint like actually ?][https://www.iforce2d.net/rube/#]), on the web. I would really like to make this a multiplayer game (using websockets ?), this is _the_ milestone I'd like to reach.


 - Box2dweb physics engine : I've tried several javascript physics engines so far, but none of them contained half the documentation, the stackoverflow-answer base, features and/or helpers box2dweb has. 
 - Pixi JS : pixi seems to be the 2D rendering engine that has this cool webgl fallback, plus the community is very dynamic as far as I can tell.
 - NodeJS : very handy self-contained webserver, and their seems not to be much to set up for socket.io in the near future.

 Hope you like it !
